                        I'd like to introduce <b><u>Apex Ping</u>!</b>
                        A minimalistic, but
                        powerful uptime &
                        performance monitoring service for websites and APIs. In
                        this post I'll cover
                        features of Apex Ping, why I chose to build it first,
                        and a
                        few things I learned
                        in the process. In future posts I'll be detailing the
                        implementation for anyone
                        who is curious.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        I soft-launched Ping about a month ago, built almost
                        100% on AWS Lambda,
                        with 500 users it has already detected over a million
                        errors, and performed
                        over 25 million checks. Big thanks to the early adopters
                        who have checked it
                        out!

                    <p class="sub-section-1">The Product</p>
                    <p class="post-content-text">
                        I've seen first-hand how embarrassing it can be when
                        customers find out
                        your product is having issues before you do, naturally
                        this can translate to
                        customers bailing on your product. Ensuring your site,
                        app, or API is stable
                        and performant is critical.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Apex Ping helps by making sure your team is notified
                        when there's a
                        performance regression, or when your end-point is
                        down
                        or unresponsive.
                        Often people rely on "it works for me", but Apex
                        Ping's
                        reporting can help
                        uncover the full story.
                    </p>

                    <p class="sub-section">Powerful Monitoring</p>
                    <p class="post-content-text">
                        Unlike some other uptime monitoring services, which
                        only
                        support HEAD
                        requests, Apex Ping support header fields and bodies
                        as
                        well. This allows
                        you to test APIs, caching behaviour, and serving
                        time,
                        as well as the typical
                        connection latency.
                        The checks listing displays the uptime, mean
                        response,
                        Apdex score, and
                        Adpex score throughout the day, week, or month. The
                        Apdex score
                        generalizes the user experience, summarizing
                        response
                        time satisfaction and
                        error responses.

                        Requests or "checks" are performed from a number of
                        selectable POPS (Point
                        of Presence), giving you a glance at the customer
                        experience all over the
                        world. Hovering a POP provides you with the
                        breakdown,
                        and coloring
                        indicates their relative health so you can instantly
                        see
                        if a region's
                        availability or performance is degraded.

                        When latency is a reflection of the user-experience,
                        it's important not to
                        ignore the outliers. The Latency view provides you
                        with
                        an intuitive look at
                        distribution throughout the selected time period,
                        where
                        the intensity of the
                        heatmap represents the number of check's within the
                        given duration.

                        experience based on a configured target latency. It
                        effectively lets you know
                        how far you are from hitting your mark, you should

                        AWS uses IAM policies to permit access to various
